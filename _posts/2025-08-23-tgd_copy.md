abstract: Limited waterway access constrains inland regions’ participation in international trade. Using the Three Gorges Dam as a quasi-natural experiment that expanded waterway access, we find that upstream firms increased trade participation, shifted routes, and expanded volumes. Beyond trade growth, firms also deepened integration into global value chains. Two-way trading firms—those that both import and export—drive these gains by importing more intermediate inputs and exporting more finished products. We also find evidence of increased processing trade, where firms transform imported inputs for export. These effects are stronger for firms in regions with greater pre-existing manufacturing capacity, showing that industrial endowments amplify the benefits of better shipping access. Finally, these trade gains improved firm performance and productivity, supporting local development. Overall, our results highlight the importance of waterway infrastructure for expanding trade connectivity, boosting growth, and better linking inland regions to global markets.
